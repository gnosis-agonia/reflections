1. What happens when you initialize a repository?
   Why do you need to do it?:

   -It creates a space where you can track all of the changes
    you have made on your own computer.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and
   the repository? What value do you think it offers?
   -It allows you more control and a chance to review before
    committing anything to the repo.
