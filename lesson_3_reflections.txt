1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    - a) Collaboration purposes. b) Backup. c) You can use multiple devices, like a cloud function. d) Sharing and reviewing code.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  - Its nice to develop in a stationary environment, especially when others are making changes and you don't want to have to sift through who's commits you are comparing.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  - A fork is a clone that is held on github's servers. These enable you to utilize github functionality and make your modifications without changing the original repository.

  - A clone is a copy of a full repository. You would use this when you want to work on a repository on your own computer. (A fork is also a type of clone.)

  - A branch is a part of the repository that goes in a different direction. Like a branch on a tree. It is good for making experimental changes or working on a particular problem before deciding if those changes will be merged into the working, main repository.
